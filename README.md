The engine is built into an electron container, but can also be executed from the web browser (with the exception of saving/launching save files).
The game "runner" is developed the same way, but can also launch as a web app with no restrictions.

**The engine does not need to be installed to play games made with it, but any game made with it can be imported back into the engine and edited fully.** (For now, textures and models are saved (as blobs) into the savedata.json for each project. Only one file is necessary to edit/play games made with the engine.)
